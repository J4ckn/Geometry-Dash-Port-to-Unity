# Geometry Dash Port to Unity

Hi, I'm porting Geometry Dash to Unity engine, trying to keep as many features as possible, this project is only a hobby project and I use my free time to develop it. I will try to release one build a week along with the progress of it. As a demo I've left a very early build with the basics, 2 game modes and a playable level but it's not final yet.
